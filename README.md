# Goatfryed's Helm Chart Collection

We promise simple, yet highly flexible helm charts for redundant application concerns. It's a singleton list. Might become more in the future. Who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The cool documentation can be found on github

```shell
helm repo add goatfryed https://goatfryed.github.io/helm-charts/
```
