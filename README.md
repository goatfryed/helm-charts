# Goatfryed's Helm Chart Collection
We promise simple, yet highly flexible helm charts for redundant application concerns.
It's a singleton list. Might become more in the future. Who knows ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

The cool documentation can be found in the charts them self. See links below.

# Spring Boot Helm Chart
A simple, yet flexible helm chart to deploy spring boot applications in kubernetes.
- Find us on <https://artifacthub.io> TODO
- [Find the actual chart readme here](charts/spring-boot/README.md). It's awesome. I promise

It's not hard. Most microservice projects I've met in the past had some.
All of them created a helm chart per application, ideally using a library chart to reuse templates.
Yet none of them had set up that couldn't be expressed in helm values easily.

Let's put an end to copy-paste low effort spring boot helm charts.
